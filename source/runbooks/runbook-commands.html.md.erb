# When the DB cpu utilization is 100%

### try restarting the pods one by one

```

kubectl rollout restart deployment hmpps-interventions-service-dashboard -n hmpps-interventions-prod
kubectl rollout restart deployment hmpps-interventions-service-api -n hmpps-interventions-prod
kubectl rollout restart deployment hmpps-interventions-ui -n hmpps-interventions-prod
kubectl rollout restart deployment hmpps-interventions-service-performance-report -n hmpps-interventions-prod

```

### If the above commands does not bring the db cpu utilization down, trying scaling down and scale up the pods

### commands for scaling down

```

kubectl scale deployment hmpps-interventions-service-dashboard -n hmpps-interventions-prod --replicas=0
kubectl scale deployment hmpps-interventions-service-api -n hmpps-interventions-prod --replicas=0
kubectl scale deployment hmpps-interventions-ui -n hmpps-interventions-prod --replicas=0
kubectl scale deployment hmpps-interventions-service-performance-report -n hmpps-interventions-prod --replicas=0

```
### commands for scaling up

```

kubectl scale deployment hmpps-interventions-service-dashboard -n hmpps-interventions-prod --replicas=2
kubectl scale deployment hmpps-interventions-service-api -n hmpps-interventions-prod --replicas=3
kubectl scale deployment hmpps-interventions-ui -n hmpps-interventions-prod --replicas=3
kubectl scale deployment hmpps-interventions-service-performance-report -n hmpps-interventions-prod --replicas=1

```

### sample command for cascade deleting draft referrals based on a condition

```
delete from referral_service_user_data where referral_id in (select dr.id from draft_referral dr
left outer join referral r on dr.id = r.id
where r.id is null and dr.created_at <= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days')

delete from referral_details where referral_id in (select dr.id from draft_referral dr
left outer join referral r on dr.id = r.id
where r.id is null and dr.created_at <= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days')

delete from draft_oasys_risk_information where referral_id in (select dr.id from draft_referral dr
left outer join referral r on dr.id = r.id
where r.id is null and dr.created_at <= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days')

delete from referral_complexity_level_ids where referral_id in (select dr.id from draft_referral dr
left outer join referral r on dr.id = r.id
where r.id is null and dr.created_at <= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days')

delete from referral_selected_service_category where referral_id in (select dr.id from draft_referral dr
left outer join referral r on dr.id = r.id
where r.id is null and dr.created_at <= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days')

delete from draft_referral where id in (select dr.id from draft_referral dr
left outer join referral r on dr.id = r.id
where r.id is null and dr.created_at <= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days')
