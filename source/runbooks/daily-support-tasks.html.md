# Daily support tasks

This page explains how a day on the support rotation works.

### Responsibilities

1. During the day, join and reply to requests in the [#refer-and-monitor-support] Slack channel.

    Setting the notifications to "All" for the day helps. Right-click on the channel, select _Change notifications_ and
    select _All new messages_.
    
    Ask for help from the [#interventions-internal] or [#interventions-dev] Slack channels, as necessary.
    Please link to the relevant message when doing so.

1. Ensure longer work is in [support tickets][new-support-ticket] in Jira and [their status][ticket-status] is up-to-date.

1. Document repetitive tasks in the [runbook].

1. Practice the [five whys][five-whys] technique when discussing issues to suggest improvements to the service
   and reduce support volume.
