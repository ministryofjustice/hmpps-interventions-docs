# Investigate NDMIS export

### Problem

We receive a report that our NDMIS export is incorrect, missing referrals, or similar data consistency issues.

We want to double-check the result of the extract job.

### Actions

<%= warning_text("Make sure you delete this data afterwards.") %>

Copy the latest NDMIS export (generated by [this batch job][report-code]) to your local machine:

```
eval $(cloud-platform decode-secret \
  --secret=reporting-s3-bucket \
  --namespace=hmpps-interventions-prod \
  --export-aws-credentials)

aws s3 cp --recursive \
  's3://eu-west-2-delius-prod-dfi-extracts/dfinterventions/dfi/csv/reports/' .
```

`cloud-platform` is the [Cloud Platform CLI tool][cli].
