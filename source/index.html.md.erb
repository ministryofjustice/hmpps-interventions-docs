# About the service

<%= warning_text("This guidance is for a technical audience, for people who need to work with the
code or operations side of the service.") %>

The ["Refer and monitor an intervention" service][service-proposition] is a digital service for
finding, referring to, recording and monitoring interventions.

[Interventions][interventions] are programmes or activities that aim to change someone's behaviour
and reduce the risk of reoffending.

The service across all components has around 700,000 requests per day. Circa 2000 service providers
and 1000 probation practitioners use it during a working day.
