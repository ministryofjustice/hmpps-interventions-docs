# Get started

You will need a [GitHub account with Ministry of Justice organisation access](https://technical-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/standards/storing-source-code.html#github-access).

Afterwards, please request to join the [@ministryofjustice/hmpps-interventions-dev](https://github.com/orgs/ministryofjustice/teams/hmpps-interventions-dev) GitHub team.

## GitHub repositories

The service has small components in separate GitHub repositories.

Live components:

- [Domain API](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-interventions-service)
- [Commissioned Rehabilitative Services (CRS) UI](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-interventions-ui)
- [Operational scripts](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-interventions-ops)

Proposed, not live components:

- [Domain event listener and Delius translator](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-delius-interventions-event-listener)
- [Intervention onboarding service](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-interventions-onboarding)

Supporting components:

- [Interventions seed data](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-interventions-seed-data) (to be deprecated in favour of the onboarding service above)
