# <%= current_page.data.title %>

Our data is extracted daily into the Analytical Platform, transformed there and exposed to the Modernisation Platform.

The Modernisation Platform exposes these data points with [QuickSight](https://aws.amazon.com/quicksight/).

(Please refer to [the Integrations page](../integrations.html) for _how_ this process works.)


### Obtaining access

This section has moved to [Confluence](https://dsdmoj.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/IC/pages/4305649780/Access+to+QuickSight+business+intelligence),
as it was more relevant for the entire team.
