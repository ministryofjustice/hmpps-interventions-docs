## Domain services

Used to display or process someone's information that does not belong in interventions.

| API | Responsibility
| - | -
| [hmpps-probation-integration-api](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-probation-integration-services) | Replacement of Community API which is slow and bulky. This is used for reading personal details, someone's responsible officers, officer teams.<br>Writing activities (NSIs), appointments, appointment outcomes, and progress notifications.
| [community-api](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/community-api) | Reading personal details, someone's responsible officers, officer teams.<br>Writing activities (NSIs), appointments, appointment outcomes, and progress notifications. The plan is to remove usage of commiunity-api
| [hmpps-assess-risk-and-needs](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-assess-risks-and-needs) | Reading risk information.<br>Writing supplementary (redacted) risk information.
| [hmpps-prisoner-search](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-prisoner-search) | Reading prisoner information.<br>This includes prison location and the release dates.


## Platform services

For features shared across many services.

| API | Responsibility
| - | -
| [hmpps-auth](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-auth) | Authenticating and authorising users given their roles and groups.<br>Issuing JWT tokens.
| [token-verification-api](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/token-verification-api) | Validating issued tokens.
| [GOV.uk notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/) | Sending emails.


## Scheduled data transfers

We need to transfer our data for further processing. Transfer is done via CronJobs:

| Component | Responsibility
|-|-
| [cronjob/data-extractor-analytics](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-interventions-service/blob/main/helm_deploy/hmpps-interventions-service/Chart.yaml#L8-L10) | Daily snapshot of raw data, transferred to the [Analytical Platform](https://user-guidance.services.alpha.mojanalytics.xyz/).<br>Used for data cleansing, exploratory analysis and further processing.
| [cronjob/generate-ndmis-performance-report](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-interventions-service/blob/main/helm_deploy/hmpps-interventions-service/templates/cronjob-ndmis-performance-report.yaml) | Daily snapshot of transformed data, transferred to National Delius Management Information System (NDMIS).<br>Used for business reporting.

[bs-svc]: https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-interventions-service/blob/main/catalog-info.yaml
[bs-ui]: https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-interventions-ui/blob/main/catalog-info.yaml


## Static and mapping data

These data sources are either indirectly used or embedded in our applications.

| Dataset | Responsibility
|-|-
| [NSI to contract type mapping](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/community-api/blob/1c6ec895e2679f19dfb571fb4c486a0dea4355ed/src/main/resources/application.yml#L122) | Mapping between *intervention contract type* and *nDelius NSI type* identifiers.<br>Maintained in the linked code.
| [Probation office data](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-reference-data/blob/main/registers/probation-offices-v0.csv) | Mapping to *nDelius location* identifiers.<br>List of probation offices.<br>UI application has a file copy.
| [Probation regions](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-reference-data/blob/main/registers/probation-regions-v0.csv) | List of probation service regions.<br>API database has a copy.
| [Police and crime commissioner (PCC) regions](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-reference-data/blob/main/registers/pcc-regions-for-probation-v0.csv) | List of the probation-specific Police and crime commissioner (PCC) regions, used for Commissioned Rehabilitative Services (CRS).<br>API database has a copy.
| üîê [Interventions seed data](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/hmpps-interventions-seed-data) | Repository to populate contract, prime provider, subcontractor and intervention data.<br>Used as-is.


## Data transformation pipeline

We need to transform our data for business intelligence dashboards.

Resource definitions:

| Component | Responsibility
|-|-
| [Analytical Platform landing bucket policy][landing-bucket-policy-tf] | Injects the Analytical Platform landing bucket secret to our environment to be used by jobs. Sets up permissions so our namespace can write to that bucket.
| [Analytical Platform landing bucket definition][landing-bucket-ap] | Creates the landing bucket for our data. The `aws_arn_for_put_permission` is populated from the `user_arn` value from the secret created above.
| [Modernisation Platform environment][mp-environment] | Defines our Modernisation Platform namespace and the GitHub team access privileges.
| [Modernisation Platform environment resources][mp-environment-resources] | Defines any resources in the environment. In a sandbox environment, a scheduled job destroys all undefined resources. Those resources must be defined here to prevent deletion.
| [Modernisation Platform bucket and its policy][mp-target-bucket-policy] | S3 bucket on the Modernisation Platform side that stores the transformed data that powers the dashboards. The bucket policy allows the Analytical Platform lambda to write into it.

[landing-bucket-policy-tf]: https://github.com/ministryofjustice/cloud-platform-environments/blob/main/namespaces/live.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/hmpps-interventions-prod/resources/analytical-platform-access.tf
[landing-bucket-ap]: https://github.com/ministryofjustice/register-my-data/blob/main/stacks/hmpps-interventions-prod/config.yaml
[mp-environment]: https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform/blob/main/environments/refer-monitor.json
[mp-environment-resources]: https://github.com/ministryofjustice/modernisation-platform-environments/tree/main/terraform/environments/refer-monitor
[mp-target-bucket-policy]: https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets/probation-referrals-datawarehouse?region=eu-west-1&tab=permissions


Dashboard data propagation happens through:

| Step | Component | Responsibility
|-|-|-
| 1 | [generic-data-analytics-extractor helm chart][extractor-helm-chart] | Defines a `CronJob` and adds it to the service deployment that creates daily snapshots from the entire database in the Analytical Platform S3 landing bucket.
| 2 | [fact, dimension, data mart definitions][dbt-definitions] | Defines the transformations into [fact and dimension tables and data marts](https://docs.getdbt.com/terms/dimensional-modeling) using [dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/introduction)
| 3 | [dbt transformation pipeline][dbt-pipeline] | Executes the defined transformations.
| 4 | [hook to copy to holding area][dbt-hook] | Defines that after a successful transformation, the data must be copied into a "holding area", awaiting transfer.
| 5 | [copy to Modernisation Platform][ap-push-export] | Defines that the contents of the "holding area" (on change) must be _moved_ from the Analytical Platform to the Modernisation Platform. It creates a lambda function that runs on an on-change event.
| 6 | [parse schemas with AWS Glue crawlers][aws-glue-crawlers] | Creates and maintains the Modernisation Platform's data sources, making transformed data usable by other tools in the Modernisation Platform.
| 7 | [mapped data source][aws-data-source] | Defines the schemas of the transformed data (in the Modernisation Platform), directly exposing them to AWS Athena and QuickSight.

To access the data:

| Step | Component | Action
|-|-|-
| 1 | [map datasets from the data source](https://eu-west-1.quicksight.aws.amazon.com/sn/start/data-sets) | Manual step in the Modernisation Platform. Each data source should be a "direct query" unless performance problems arise.
| 2 | [create analyses in QuickSight](https://eu-west-1.quicksight.aws.amazon.com/sn/start/analyses) | Manual step in the Modernisation Platform. Each analysis should be specific to the business problem.
