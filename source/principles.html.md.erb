# Principles

## Operational restrictions

- Do **not** access production data directly, except for emergencies.
- **Never** run `psql` in a pod on _preprod_ or _prod_ namespaces.
  All input and output are logged and can easily lead to a breach of personal data.

Instead, rely on [port-forwarding from preprod](./runbooks/connect-to-preprod.html).


## Inherited principles

- [Development principles](https://technical-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/#principles) in the Ministry of Justice
- [üîê Data principles](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PMKLRzoNbPBngEBHErobBMW5PhqHiBP1AAFMhUWuWuQ/edit?usp=sharing)


## Service code principles

- We store when specific actions happen and by whom instead of overwriting a state.
- We build domain APIs, not CRUD APIs.
- We invariably enforce business rules in the domain API.
- We use consumer-driven contract testing.
- We keep the `main` branches deployable at all times.
